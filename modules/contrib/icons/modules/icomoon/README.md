## Icons Icomoon

When creating a new icon set for icomoon in drupal.

1) First go to http://icomoon.io. Create your own icon set and download it to a
folder. From drupal standards I would recommend the libraries folder.

2) After you have done that make sure the icons module and icons icomoon module
are enabled.

3) Go to /admin/appearance/icon_set in drupal 8 and create a new icon set for
the icomoon plugin.

4) Next step after submitting the form is determining the location of the
icomoon icons folder. And enter this path in the configuration form of the icon
set.

5) Submit and you are done. And you can use the notation below to use the added
icons in your output through render arrays. Or go to your menu and create a new
link.

```php
$icon = [
  '#type' => 'icon',
  '#icon_set' => 'icon_set_configuration_entity_id',
  '#icon_name' => 'icon_name',
];
```

Or you could use a combination of the configuration entity id with the icon
name like this:

```php
$icon = [
  '#type' => 'icon',
  '#icon_id' => 'icon_set_configuration_entity_id:icon_name',
];
```
